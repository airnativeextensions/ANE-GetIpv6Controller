# GetIpv6Controller

The [GetIpv6Controller](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.GetIpv6Controller) extension 
gives access to a simple conversion utility to convert an IP address into the appropriate IPv4 / IPv6 address based on the current network environment.


### Features:

- IP Address conversion utility
- Single API interface - your code works across supported platforms with no modifications
- Sample project code and ASDocs reference


As with all our extensions you get access to a year of support and updates as we are 
continually improving and updating the extensions for OS updates and feature requests.


## Documentation

The [Wiki](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GetIpv6Controller/wiki) forms the best source of detailed documentation for the extension along with the [asdocs](https://distriqt.github.io/ANE-GetIpv6Controller/asdocs). 

Quick Example: 

```actionscript
var ipData:String = GetIpv6Controller.instance.getIpv6( "192.0.2.1" );
```
